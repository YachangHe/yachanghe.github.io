### Abstract

The spectral invariants theory (p-theory) has received much attention in the field of quantitative remote sensing over the past few decades and has been adopted for modeling of canopy solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). However, the spectral invariant properties (SIP) in simple analytical formulae have not been applied for modeling canopy fluorescence anisotropy primarily because they are parameterized in terms of leaf total scattering, which precludes the differentiation between forward and backward leaf SIF emissions. In this study, we have developed the canopy-SIP SIF model by combining geometric-optical (GO) theory to account for asymmetric leaf SIF forward and backward emissions at the first-order scattering and by modeling multiple scattering based on the p-theory, thus avoiding the dependence on radiative transfer models. The applicability of the model simulations especially over 3D heterogeneous canopies was improved by incorporating canopy structure through multi-angular clumping index, and by modeling single scattering from the four components of the scene in view according to the GO approach. 
The results show good consistency with both the state-of-the-art SIF models and multi-angular field SIF observations over grass and chickpea canopies. The coefficient of determination (R2) between the simulated SIF and field measurements was 0.75 (red) and 0.74 (far-red) for chickpea, and 0.65 (both red and far-red) for grass. The average relative error was approximately 3% for 1D homogeneous scenes when comparing the canopy-SIP SIF model simulations to the SCOPE model simulations, and around 4% for the 3D heterogeneous scene when comparing to the LESS model simulations. The results indicate that the proposed approach for separating asymmetric leaf SIF emissions is a robust way to keep a balance between satisfactory simulation accuracy and efficiency. Model simulations suggest that neglecting the leaf SIF asymmetry can lead to an underestimation of canopy red SIF by 6.3% to 42.6% for various leaf biochemical and canopy structural parameters. This study presents a simple but efficient analytical approach for canopy fluorescence modeling, with potential for large-scale canopy fluorescence simulations.
